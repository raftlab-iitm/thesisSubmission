## Thesis submission
Once synopsis is approved, the thesis submission link will be active in the workflow.

## No-dues
During the thesis review time, request for the no-dues 'certificate' from the different departments at IIT:  
1. Alumni Club
2. Finance section
3. Library
4. AE Dept.
5. Hostel  

This was via mail earlier. It is now being done through the [Student Services Portal](https://ssp.iitm.ac.in/).

## Thesis review
Once the two reviewers send back the review comments (in around 3 months or so), the revised thesis has to be submitted within a month.
Each review comment has to be addressed with adequate additions or corrections quoted from the thesis in a reply document. The comments should be well thought out and the opinions of the reviewer, who is an expert in the field, should be given appropriate importance. For this reason, comments may often require a considerable amount of additional research work.

## Thesis Viva (Defense)
After the comments have been addressed, the revised thesis, the reply document and a short abstract for the work should be sent to the department office requesting for scheduling of the thesis viva. The office staff will send the documents and intimate the reviewer(s) and doctoral committee for a convenient date. Once, the date is fixed you will recieve confirmation.  
The viva presentation is typically 30 mins including 5 mins for questions. Confirm the expected time duration before you begin preparation. The reply document will be sent to the reviewers by the dept. office. However, it may not be recieved or read by the reviewers. Do not assume it has been read in detail. During the presentation, the candidate is expected to go through the reply document and review the comments and replies. If there are only a few comments recieved, the replies may also be included at the end of the presentation. Add additional slides as an appendix in the presentation in case you end up having extra time to present or in the event the audience requires more details on a topic.

## After acceptance of thesis
_Congrats on obtaining your research degree!_  
After the viva, update the date on your thesis to that of your viva on the front page and on the certificate inside. Ensure your bio-data and the doctoral committee list are attached to the end in the appropriate format. Then, upload the thesis through the workflow link.  
A few documents have to be sent in a google drive link to the Research Evaluation Unit for printing of the degree certificate. These documents at the moment are:  
1. A passport size photo with the filename (Roll No).jpg
2. Final draft of thesis
3. Scanned copy of your previous degree certificate
4. All no-dues certificates if not obtained through the student services portal.
